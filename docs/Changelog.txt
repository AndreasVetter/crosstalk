Version 0.2 (2020-07-10):

- Some code cleanup

- New boot files in sdcard (support for Raspberry Pi 4)

- Configurable cursor color (default black)
  Use parameter "cursorcolor" in cmdline.txt as 8 hex digits (AARRGGBB), 
  e.g. cursorcolor=00ff00ff for magenta

- Configurable bootmode: parameter "bootmode" in cmdline.txt (default 0)
  bootmode = 0 => load included snapshot memory image (smalltalk/src/snapshot.h)
  bootmode = 1 => load file "snapshot.im" from SD card using small reads (slow)
  bootmode = 2 => load file "snapshot.im" from SD card, memory cached read (faster)

- Library configuration
  Automatically find paths to arm-none-eabi cross libc/libstdc++ in smalltalk/raspberry/Makefile

Known problems in version 0.2:

- Doesn't boot on Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB version
- No support for a real-time clock (the Raspberry Pi doesn't have one by default)
- Display scaling is unsupported
- The keyboard buffer implementation is extremely simple and can lead to bouncing
- Changing the VM resolution to >= 2^10 pixels (e.g., 1024*1024) crashes the VM 
  (probably a limitation of the object size in Smalltalk-80)

Nice to have:
- Changing the screen resolution should redraw the screen borders at least
- No fallback to bootmode 0 if snapshot.im not existent/broken on SD card
- Build infrastructure could use improvements

Upgrading from version 0.1:

- Remove "kernel8-32.img" from the boot partition (otherwise, the Raspberry Pi 4 
  will not boot)
